Port to Lazarus and Linux
    Set it up with SQLite.
       Have to recreate the DB there, I guess.
       I wanted a more self-contained, lower-maintenance option anyway.

Persist the category setting.
Add a per-class  hours setting.
Add duration to entry screen.
Add archiving old entries to a named file or folder.
Enter should edit a time record.

Better file format
	If we supported SQL, could do more interesting things - filtering, sorting, etc.
		NexusDB embedded is free on the D2006 extras CD.

archive data
	selected classes
	before a given date
	submitted & paid
		leave one in place so the class stays?
			or, rework to have a real client table?
improve Open
	start from the MRU location
when the from time passes the to time, increment the to time as well.
make sure "12:0" doesn't appear in either time on open.

New/Delete/Save As
	New should bring up User Info after creating the database.
